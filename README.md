# Grand Canyon Sculpture

We live in the UK but before COVID my mum used to love visiting family over in the US with them owning a house in the retirement home Sun city, AZ. I think she went a couple times as a teen and has fold memories with her dad there and when she took me Pre-COVID we had a great time and did some travelling while we were there. One of the places she really loved and still talks about is monument valley and the grand canyon. 
We haven't been able to go back since COVID and the whole situation has changed so I want to build her this to go up on her wall to remind her of the fold memories. 
This will be made from sheets of 3mm plywood that I got for free and cut into a topological map, I will them finish and apply epoxy to the bottom to mirror the (Colorado?) river.
